This test project is using the Microsoft.TeamFoundation.* set of assemblies, and it requires that
you'll have the Team Foundation client libraries installled. 
You can check here to see how to add those to your .Net Tab in the Add Reference dialog:

Note that this is the only project that requires the client libraries, and they are _not_
required for SvnBridge to operate.
